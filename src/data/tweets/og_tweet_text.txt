all right so today I want to show you

step by step how to use AI agents for

Solana trading um actually you know what

I'm just going to show you around this

GitHub real quick because this has all

of my code and it's not going to be here

forever I I won't have it here forever I

promise that so if you want access to it

just go to mv.com you get the road map

resources and the GitHub here you can

see the GitHub has literally all of my

code and 10 plus agents maybe not 10 yet

but we have one two got this trading

Trading agent the strategy agent the

risk agent the copy agent the whale

agent the sentiment agent the listing

ARB agent the focus agent the funding

agent and the liquidation agent and the

chart analysis agent dude this is crazy

we have so many agents here running and

we have them running all day dude so I

actually have the focus agent here that

I'm launching right now so let's go

ahead and uh go ahead and read the read

me once you get to the GitHub read the

read me all you got to do is go to

mv.com you can then get your starter

pack which has your road map and

everything and the road map actually has

the AI GitHub here so you have

everything dude everything I have you

have all you do is go hit star hit the

star here and then Fork allows you to

copy the code once you copy the code

then you'll have all the code that I

have and that's beautiful dude that's

beautiful so much love to you and um

first things first today I want to go

ahead and you can see there's a little

bit of a error here um but also I want

to go ahead and launch a couple new uh

Lambda in or one Lambda instance so the

last two days dude that I've done this

you can see the usage here um I'm using

it's a type of machine learning and

evolutionary algorithms to build out

millions of trading strategies and you

can see here I spent

$164 uh on Friday I believe and I and

the day before I spent 160 but both days

I left the house with it running it was

crazy dude I just burnt so much cash so

I'm going to try to be more locked in

today and I'm going to get this live

here so I'm launching this at

$14.32 per hour um so it's very

expensive but yeah dude I left for like

hours I left for hours dude and I was

just running I was hot I was hot I was

like oh F I'm so grateful that I didn't

fall asleep with it at least so you know

this part of the game so since it's part

of the game I'm just grateful to play

dude I'm just I'm just grateful to be

here dog just another day in this

beautiful life I'm so so grateful I see

your 777s Anthony how are you dude 777

holy Keith good to see you

777 dude this is beautiful beautiful

beautiful beautiful humans Shilling

something tell me your pitch bro what's

good about it okay so what else do we

need to do you can see my API is messing

up too dude I don't know what's going on

here okay this is good though this is

good this is good we having some we're

having some API problems remember I

launched the API last

week hi moev 777 chart analysis for BTC

on the 15minute time frame the trend is

sideways I'm going to turn her off

because we got a problem here you can

see there's a error there's a nun type

here so my funding rate's not working

and my copy box not working Bruh Bruh so

what do we do about that we got to fix

it okay we got a couple minutes fix it

here let me go ahead and make sure my

copi clipboard is here dude I want to be

ready for that okay so I'm going to go

here and get all that ready I got my my

Lambda notes here um I'mma set a I'm not

going to set a timer oh yeah serly P

timer set timer so I can uh make sure

to not forget about this okay now I'm

going to go here and first off I'm going

to grab my GitHub here because actually

there's a couple new people I got to get

on the

API so let me go ahead and do that real

quick and fix this here at the same damn

time at the same damn

time all right so I'm going to fix the

I'm going add the person to the API real

quick but the API don't even work right

now clearly That's crazy dude

so here's the AI agents for trading and

I already showed you how to get all of

that so you're

Gucci remember you just go to mv.com and

you get all the code so all the code

you're going to see today you're going

to have all access to it it's right here

Moon just go to mb.com grab the road map

Discord and GitHub you go down to the

road map the road map has everything how

do you get started algo training and you

go to the GitHub dude and you click the

GitHub and you hit the star on the

GitHub and then all the code in the

GitHub is in the source file bro look at

this we got everything here this is

crazy I can't believe I give all this

away for free agents here can see all

the agents here 777 dude much love much

[Music]

love he said bro going crazy dude I I

always been crazy bro bro glad you're

here I'm glad you're finally waking up

to it I'm glad you're finally waking up

to it I'm way too crazy I go way too

hard for you fam so glad that you're

here

though I'm always going

crazy I'm always going crazy dude I'm

always going crazy of course of course

everybody else is sleeping much love to

you dude

777 so we got five minutes to fix this

bug dude what's going on 2.0 out 10 stay

focused go after your dreams and keep

moving towards your goals L thank you

okay

so um

I need to check this out so copy scanner

let's go check out what's going on with

that

green oh was just there it was just

there AI on boarding AI Discord

[Music]

all right so dude I don't know what's

going on with the servers the thing okay

so how do I fix this I go I'll check out

the API here

yeah screen

R oh it got killed that's why

[Applause]

okay there we go we

back we back dude we back wait so why

did it

die why did it die bro bro so you can

see my funding rate party here so my

server just died I don't know

why I'm going to ask AI dude

I'm an AI guy I'm an AI

guy of course I'm going use

AI AO MonoQ Bot 777 fcoin has high

funding at

48.63 annual AI suggests nothing with

50% confidence analysis fcoin has a high

funding rate of

48.63 indicating a speculative Market

with salana has negative funding at Mana

15.12% annual AI suggests nothing with

50% confidence analysis the funding rate

for so is negative but the overall

Bitcoin Market is in an uptrend

so you can see that my server actually

shut down on me which is super

weird can you explain what may have

happened here um it killed my API and I

just came back and all I had to do is

restart it but um yeah it kind of

confused me and concerns me for the

future what can I do to make sure that

it doesn't happen again and what

happened looking at the logs I can

explain exactly what

happened so memory overflow the CSV file

is too

large here's how to fix it add memory

monitoring add rate

limiting the server killed itself

because it ran out of memory trying to

load and convert 10 M plus Rose CSV

file does the above approach change

anything else like would all of the

calls be the same

still is there anything that is going to

break it like on the other side when I

call it do I have to change anything

do I need to change anything on the

server calls or will this just

help fix

it I don't want to have to change

anything on the call side on the like

non-server side

dude my thing's not working anymore I

think I got to pay for it

I mean

[ __ ] can you hear me

now yeah she ain't working bro bro you

think I need to pay for yo 777

dude good to see y'all Michael Cod

Trader what up

damn my AI thing's not working anymore

you think I got

to I'm going reset

it my whisper flow

what's up

homie damn dude it's not working no more

can't I can't code without it I don't

type I don't type anymore so let me try

to get Flo flow Pro beard

build GNA build it try to get it I'm

trying to buy

it try to buy it right now dude

cuz I I am not paying for

it as of

now and I was wondering how long it's

going to let me not pay for it for but

maybe today is the day so maybe I'll

just pay for it real quick and see if

it's Gucci

what's the day today 120

ow I just hurt my

hand all right now I got

Pro you working now bro

seen Minute dude a

minute so that's far bro that's far it's

not working today

but maybe there's an update or

something they fall about whisper hide

View

about this Mac whisper flow 2.010

distractions will always exist it's up

to you to decide if they overpower your

focus on greatness thank you thank

you are you working

BR read

it read it D don't play read the whole

thing

all of it I don't care how good you are

and anything you don't have discipline

you ain't nobody nobody nothing nothing

because you give up under the slightest

struggle without discipline 100% with

discipline is doing what you hate to do

but do it like you love it doing what

you hate to do but do it like you love

it that's that is a great quote and if

you can do that you could be successful

in anything well you normally are you

let it run all day without me running

something okay um so fourth number

four launch four

now five

later and then

hopefully then

hopefully six and seven

Manana Manana Manana Manana Manana

Manana Manana damn dude this taking a

long time Mund moving slow Mund that

moving so so slow dude come on step on

the guys

boy come on you getting super Puerto

Rican on them all Puerto Ricans get free

free uh free boot camp access actually

so you are Puerto Rican and you live

here

dude I believe CO's a great equalizer so

of course it's

free SRC here the Fitness we want to go

up in the fitness here and then we want

to go to fitness BT Fitness vbt and

we're going to sa 4 four this

time and we're going to hit save and

then we're going to hit run just run it

up please because this is the only

chance we have Let's test it out first

because we don't want to be some Noob

tubing Noob tubing Moos okay let's go

ahead and just give it a quick little

runny

run

CD SRC okay okay we CD SRC we're going

to have one little run here see if it

does

anything that copy good boy okay so what

else we got here

dude what's up what's up what's up oh it

did not work okay so what's the

eror

404 turns new man

damn it didn't work dude okay so let's

go

see what do we do wrong here what did we

do

[Music]

wrong I didn't write the answer down it

was something something with number

though fud dude

fold four here let's see the data sets

make sure we data dog

still full four 60 Minute data full four

okay there's clearly something wrong

here why do I know that

because because I do

dude I've done this so many times

now repetition is key repetition

repetition repetition I don't know

anything till I do it a ton of times and

then I kind of kind of know it you

know so let's go see what the eror

is number okay so this is the same

one

um let's see if I can go here am I back

yet am I back yet you can still see the

screen

damn

dude I wonder where

I put

that okay so um let's just go ask AI

damn dude this is tough

because um um okay no no it's not that

tough though it's just it sucks

because okay let's just talk about it I

get this bug here and I got the same bug

last week I can't remember exactly what

I did but it definitely had something to

do with uninstalling n and then

reinstalling the correct version so

let's try to debug this uh with that and

you can see my requirements.txt here uh

I thought I changed it to the right

version but I clearly didn't because I

still get the same bug we got last week

and we fixed it by uninstalling and then

reinstalling the right version it was

just a conflict between I think Vector

BT and number so we just got to get on

the right version but you got to tell me

which one it is

dude all right so let's say

requirements.txt here as

well let's run it

up let's run it up dude this is the game

we play all day I love it so so much

dude love it I love I love it copy

okay let's just keep running it up they

tell us to slow down we just keep

running it up dude we just keep running

it up yes we have to it's all we can do

it's all we can do dude copy paste

what you think about this

though okay let's say

csrc and now let's run the thing again

and see if we can get it

going let's try it again that's all we

can do is we can just keep trying just

keep swimming that's all we can do d

nope same

bu so let's go ahead and try it again

copy let's say CD dot dot okay and then

P uninstall and then we're going to say

pip

install I knew I was going to make it I

just ain't know how a nobody

but I knew this world is what you make

it you create your own environment it

all starts with a vision what you can

imagine you can

create you can imagine you can

create facts B big

facts big fact

B CD

SRC big fax B which you can imagine you

can create

what you can imagine you can

create give me some Bible verses around

this three of them

please all right certainly so we got uh

3:20 says now to him who is able to

immeasurably immeasurably more than all

ask or imagine according to his

power that is at work within

us make sure these have layman's terms

explanations to to him as well as

they're a little

confusing for as he thinketh in his

heart all right so let's read this one

again with the the

explanation now to him who is able to do

immeasurably more than all we ask or

imagine according to his power that is

at work within us

God is capable of doing far more than we

can even think about or dream of we

might have big ideas and hopes but go

God can surpass those in ways we can't

even

comprehend it's a reminder that his

power is at work in our

lives helping us achieve our great

greatest dreams 777 dude much love much

love 237 here we got four as he thinketh

in his heart so he so is he eat and

drink

Scythe he to thee but his heart is not

with

thee these are so complex dude that's

the only part that's hard for me

explanation this verse means that our

thoughts and beliefs shape who we are if

someone thinks negatively or poorly

about themselves that's often how

they'll Act

it also suggests that sometimes people

might say one thing but mean another

it's a reminder to be

authentic and true to our beliefs and

intentions Genesis 1:1 in the beginning

God created the heavens and the

Earth

explanation 777 this verse tells us that

God started everything by creating the

universe and the world we live in it

emphasizes that all of creation came

from God's desire and

Imagination this shows the incredible

power of creation and sets the stage for

understanding our own ability to create

in our lives 777 dude I think this is

working because it's taking so freaking

long how many we got population size of

120 gener generations of

12 0% done here you can

see okay okay okay

okay okay okay okay

okay yes dude yes much love much love

let's get it dude let's get it every day

every day they try to slow us down no

way no way no

way okay I believe this works now and I

also believe that code is a great

equalizer that's why I show this stuff

dude CU if I can Inspire one of you cool

cats if I could if I could Inspire one

of you cool cats to code dude

[ __ ] that's it that's all I

[Music]

need Hebrews 1211 thank you

bro explain this one to

me 7% done

perfect uh no discipline seems Pleasant

at the time but painful later on however

it produces a harvest of righteousness

and peace for those who have been

trained by it yo 777 thank you

bro this verse is discussing the idea of

discipline and how it affects our lives

here's a breakdown discipline is

difficult the verse starts by

acknowledging that discipline is often

hard and

uncomfortable when we go through

discipline whether it's from parents

teachers or even

God it usually feels painful at the

time this could refer to the struggles

we face when learning life lessons or

correcting our behaviors long-term

benefits

here however the verse offers Hope by

starting that or stating that although

the experience of discipline is tough it

leads to positive outcomes over time

this discipline helps us grow and

develop into better

people the Harvest of righteousness and

peace suggests that through difficult

lessons we can become more virtuous

righteous and find inner calm

peace the phrase those who have been

trained by it implies that it's

important to accept and learn from the

difficult experiences rather than

resisting

them when we embrace the lessons that

discipline teaches us we can cultivate

good character traits and a sense of

peace in our

lives Hebrews 1211 reminds us that while

going through challenges and discipline

might be tough those experiences can

lead to significant personal growth and

peace in the long run it encourages us

to view hard times as opportunities for

improvement rather than just hardships

thank you dude

777 much love munde grandfather was a

crusader Mev do you have a way to use

Crusader for free 1410 concentrate all

your thoughts upon the work at hand the

sun's rays do not burn until brought to

a focus Alexander Crader

coding code crusader

no I don't know what Crusader

is just don't know what it is

Dude Looks like we finished here yes

negative 142 perfect we're live here

okay so that's beautiful that works

um so let's just go ahead and update our

our requirements at txt so next time it

will it will work right away you know

it will work right away right away right

away right away much love to you dude

I'm glad you're here 777 thank you thank

you thank you thank you thank you thank

you for being here thank you for sharing

your love and your Bible verses your

ideas your sevens dude let's get it all

day okay yes okay okay okay okay okay

okay let's say uh

screen screen

s it's S1

okay so this is going to be the first

one right here we're going to run three

screens three screens because we're

going to do it triple time he's going to

do it triple

time he's a triple he's a triple time

kind of guy python run

it okay that's live okay let's get

screen two here

yes triple

time did I just run that one

it's looking a little suspicious

here okay which one did I write py g85

85 okay grammar F .1 grammar F 110 okay

BC BTC basic vbbt basic vbbt

what dude no

way I did not do that bro I did not do

that don't tell me that don't tell me

that right now grammar fall

PTC basic in I'm not negotiating with

myself yeah the deal was already made

the deal was made when I set out at the

beginning of the summer and said this is

the training plan I'm doing I signed

that contract with myself I'm doing it

I'm doing it you know throughout the

that process you'll start talking to

yourself like man I got to I think I

need to maybe if we nope

no this is nonnegotiable so this one BTC

basic

vbt and the next one is basic okay so

we're Gucci at least thank

God I just had a a typo

here luckily it didn't

matter okay we got the second one

running now we're going get the third

one

running that's

three okay so we got all three running

perfect so um if you're new here welcome

777 but we got these three evolutionary

algorithms running here these are

creating a million strategies but I got

three of them so if you do the math

there if you take the 1 million and you

multiply it by three that equals 3

million 3 million strategies here on a

Monday morning so GM GM let's see how

much money I've spent oh my God that

would that took 04 hours dude or that

took 39 hours dude what the hell that

was I spent $6 right there dude Jesus

that's

crazy crazy crazy stuff kids kids this

is crazy stuff AO MonoQ Bot 777 fcoin has

high funding at 68.1 2% annual AI

suggests nothing with 50% confidence

analysis fcoin has a high funding rate

liqui salana has negative funding at

14.52% annual AI suggests nothing with

50% confidence analysis funding rate is

negative but BTC is in an uptrend so no

clear signal to

buy you really be talking a

lot you really be talking a lot okay so

I want to look in the Deep seek deep

seek in

cursor so somebody said

that 3.01 your focus determines your

reality let's get back to coding and

achieving your

goals anybody know how to put deep seek

in the cursor here I think people were

talking about

that uh deep sea

I was able to get deep seek V3 working

and cursor and the new code Myro running

through incursor through the continue

extension I was able to get deep SE

three working on cursor though in cursor

settings I just typed in the model deep

seek V3 in my local

AMA has anyone tried

out so let's go ahead and try to get

this deep seek going dude anybody use

deep seek in

cursor I'mma ask Trent

let's ask

him wake

up wake

up we just add it to the

cursor settings wake up Trent wake

up wake up dude

wake

up uh let's say deep seek deep seek um

what's it called token list not token

list deep seek how do we say that bro

bro not token list deep seek uh Max

tokens token length what's that call

dude damn my brain is weak today dog

deep seek uh token Max token token

limit yeah context

window uh let's say deep seek

cursor Reddit nice dude now he's

thinking okay nice got it okay I've been

using deep seek as my coding assistant

for a while was earlier using curer with

GPT and Claude but I've run out of

tokens deep seek Works equally good or

slightly less better than gbt and Claude

although it's making tail tall claims on

his documentation is outpouring

both I've heard literally nothing but

good things about it I don't think it

could be rated any

higher nice dude code stroll 22 bill is

King for me what is cod

straw I mean this is this is why I love

being a developer dude because like

we're in the game we're in the game

dude we're in the game

dude locked bro we're always

locked yeah I don't know though

um deep seek let's just sign up and see

if we can get this cracking I's say deep

seek models in pricing I think it's

cheap

or I think it's much cheaper that's why

we're using it okay Max token output

contact link is 64k so input

0.14 deduction rules how do you sign

up how do we sign up up and give China

our

data I want China to have all my data CU

I already know their data

dogs your first API call here

[Music]

all right deep seek platform

probably log

in for sign

up um I'm G sign up

here and no way I might log in with my

Google

account no way sorry try

sorry dog you know like I [ __ ] with you

but at the same time I'm not going to

sign with my Google account I don't [ __ ]

with you like

that not like that homeboy sorry China I

love you though I love you I do I do I

do I do it's all love it's all love it's

all love but I ain't going to give you

my I ain't going to give you my Gmail

stuff you know like I know the extent to

the to the to the love I'mma give y'all

and while I [ __ ] with you heavy B hey

try not [ __ ] with you heavy dude I ain't

going to give you my Gmail direct you

already probably have access to it you

probably already have access to it let's

be real dude let's be real you probably

already got access but I'm not going to

just like give it to you every

day not just going to go sign up for

Chinese companies and give you my Gmail

every time I can I'm going at least try

to be a

little a little uh you

know whatever cautious yeah I'm just

going to be a little

cautious yeah yeah how about

that I think I'm just going to give

China all my data on purpose well I'm

going give it some of it I'm going to

use Tik Tok

yes I'm going to use your AI because

it's cheaper yes yes you got me yes okay

it's it is what it is let me top up my

balance here let me give you some money

I'll give you my credit card wait they

give you

$2

oh they gave me $2 in credy what what

nice people I love you thank you so this

is my API key API key uh this is my uh

Jan

20 create API key

here let's copy

it done

okay and then let's let's go here to uh

where we at with it uh we're going to go

to the AI

agents we're going to go to

the I see on the can you see my screen

right now just double check triple check

I don't think you can so I'm going to go

to my EnV here and

say

deep seek

key equals whatever the key is something

that truly exists in all of us it's very

simple this is what I

believe and I'm willing to die for

it in the example

here un key deep SE key

your deep seat key is here dude be

careful be careful be careful be careful

dude okay so don't share that with

anybody okay um I actually need to put

it in my in my cursor as well so let's

go here and say settings Pro cursor

settings here and models and then maybe

it has it on here already deep seek oh

V3 is that the one we're

using deep seek V3

here oh but I don't need to use my API

key I don't know dude now I'm just

lost now I'm just lost what am I even

doing I I'm using cursor I don't

I don't need to do all this

right that's crazy

stuff

sheesh so you can see

here

screen I'm over here and I just have

deep seek I just click

it

duh this isv example I just updated

here

API I don't know what I ch change

there I don't

know but it is what it

is it's a time we got to be here AO moev

777 fcoin has high funding at 66.0 5%

annual AI suggests nothing with 50%

confidence nothing analysis the overall

BTC Market is in an uptrend but the high

funding rate of 66.0 5 salana has

negative funding at my

14.11% annual AI suggest suggests

nothing with 50% confidence analysis the

funding rate for soul is negative

indicating potential downward pressure

but the overall Bitcoin Market is in

okay

so I'm curious to see if this deep seek

works so let's say

l can you just walk me through this API

P step by step so I understand all the

code okay so we can see here sure let's

break down this should be deep seek V3

okay and I wonder what it is like if I

go here

to

[Music]

um I mean sorry for tagging you Trent

I'm an idiot honestly

okay so I just want to see here what's

it looking

like does it call it correctly I mean

this looks

fine it's

fast yeah deep seek right here okay well

cursor makes this super easy

so um deep seek is here in my cursor and

I don't know what to tell you about it I

don't know what I should do with it

because now ai is just a

commodity this is awkward now this is

very very awkward because I thought I

was going to have to do a lot of work

here to like get it implemented or

something but cursor just makes things

super easy

here okay that's cool that's cool that's

cool with me dude I'm cool with easy

okay so let's say we got that

implemented uh launch new GES done fix

copy bot and API

done I got a funding R I kind of want to

build wait it looks like this one back

to claw though

H Deep seek to save 80%

so that's pretty fire if it's 80%

cheaper but is it as good is the

question that's the question

dude is it as good

so I kind of want to build out this

funding or

but so the one thing I need to figure

out here is

in hyper liquid how to get the funding

rate so I got the funding agent

here and what I want to do here is

update

her uh let's go ahead and

say please push all and commit all and

the commit message will be added deep

seek

AI into the

that's all

though oh God oh God that's all I did

that's all I did

dude I could do it I guess get

ad get

commit

um get commit

deep

seek

added that's it

though okay get push

all right dude so I just updated all the

code here so you have access to all what

I have access to just go to mv.com from

mv.com you get your road map where do I

get started and Alo trading this road

map Discord and GitHub the road map

shows you exactly how to automate your

trading step by step down here at the AI

agents you have the GitHub okay the

GitHub takes you here dude once you get

to the GitHub you hit star in order to

keep all the code or bookmarket and to

actually get the code click Fork Fork it

dude Fork it you get all the

code okay you can see one minute ago I

added to the EnV

example deep seek key here AI Services

anthropic open Ai and deep seek now but

it doesn't really do anything yet so

we'll just we'll just mess around with

it for today and um maybe add

it here in our um next little run of

this funding agent but the funding agent

is something I want to [ __ ] with today

dude so I want to pull up my

uh hyper liquid stuff

because I might already

have I don't think I do though VI and

terminal open and visual studio code

embarrassing huh it's quite

embarrassing so this is what I was

looking for this before actually that's

why I'm already on it you can see

funding rate get funding rate

data bro funding

rate nah see I got to make a call old

maybe ah same one same

Z Okay so let's go over to the

uh hyper

liquid documentation

here oh look who the [ __ ] pops up here

look aty doy dude look aty doy who put

everybody on the hyper

liquid I don't

know not me not me not me not me I love

you look at the doy do look at the doy

he's everywhere he's he's

everywhere web socket we're going to go

ahead here and say python

SDK API examples hyper liquid examples

let's go to examples basic

[Music]

basic spot order spot to

per um none of these are them so what do

we do what do we do well you know what

let's bring back that other folder here

get the old school vs code up in here

and let's just look through some of

these nice funks

because I feel

like symbol info would have them

yeah symbol info might have

it okay

um but that's not even a call either so

let's just look through all these get

open interest here

get

liquidations so these aren't actual

calls here let's go to the top though

because ask bid um might have

it get spot and ho ass spot

symbol oh that boy

funny get all spot symbols

here get size and pics decimals

nah limit order nah adjust leverage

size account value here update

leverage get open high low close volume

data Chopper that boy out of

here

coin data DF data DF calculate vwap with

symbol Supply demand zoms get spot

position get

position I need to get the hyper liquid

um pretty much

the the funding rate for what I'm trying

to build here

so fetch candle snapshot maybe so we'll

look at that in a second

here I've made hundreds of thousands of

dollars with this trading bot framework

and I'm not only going to let you steal

it I'm going to help you m master in the

next 15 days in the algo trade Camp if

you are a crypto Trader who is ambitious

committed and persistent and you're

typically good at what you do but your

trading results are just not where you

want them to be well here's a quick

question for you how would it feel if

you could have a trading bot that traded

for you for the rest of your life with

or without you logging into the computer

each day you see I'm just a regular dude

but for the last few years I've been

using trading Bots to manage my

admittedly low s fig personal portfolio

While others struggle with controlling

their emotions staring at the charts all

day when you meet me at the algo trade

Camp I'm going to give you my exact

blueprint look we've all seen the

countless ads the cliches the kids in

the rented Lambos telling you how to

trade this isn't that this is a proven

trading bot system backed by real data

and thousands of hours of research into

automated trading systems I put this

system to the test using it to build a

swarm of trading Bots to manage my own

personal portfolio while I can't give

you a plug-and playay set in forget and

make a billion dollars overnight bot I

put my money where my mouth is and I use

this exact framework to build all of my

trading bot but look you've seen trading

bots in the wild you've heard of

successful algo Traders and you hear of

quants that have become wildly

successful and make crazy money so you

know it's possible to automate you're

trading and you're watching this video

right now so I know you're super smart

because searching for a better more

efficient way to trade that's just

something smart people do and because

you're smart you also know there's a

little something extra you know there's

a little piece of magic Miss mixed into

all of now I know what it feels like

dude not just to not make money trading

but to lose money due to emotions or

just my poor human judgment everything

else I could just work harder at and I

would get better but for trading for

some reason I could never get over the

emotions the times where I'd be up all

night staring at the charts just hoping

it would go my way just to fall asleep

to a liquidation email when you know

you're ambitious and you're extremely

persistent but you just can't figure out

the game of trading and to feel like

dude I'm I'm never going to stop trading

but I keep losing look I get that it's

normal for manual Traders hand Traders

lose money remember 95% lose I want to

take you from that feeling of losing due

to emotions to being a dominant force in

the crypto

Market I want to help you automate your

trading for the rest of your life so you

can build any trading bot that you could

ever imagine I will help you automate

your trading only if you are willing to

step up challenge yourself and take this

Challenge and I will help you automate

your trading in the next 15 days in the

algo trade Camp here's the big secret

you've been waiting for as an automated

Trader from home home there's really

only three things you need to do to be

extremely successful number one you have

to build great trading ideas build a

list of great trading ideas you then

test those ideas to see if they worked

in the past and if they worked in the

past then build a bot with tiny size to

make sure they still work in the live

market if you can do all three of those

things it's pretty hard not to make

money in fact I've never seen anyone who

has great trading ideas who tested them

constantly and deployed them with tiny

size not have success with algo trading

I just haven't seen it dude and here's

another Fact one good trading bot can

wipe out all bad financial decisions you

made in your entire life and I know this

because it happened to me when you

combine these three different elements

success isn't only possible it's

repeatable this is my RBI framework

comes down to researching R back testing

B and then implementing into Bots I and

when you make the right decision and you

decide to meet me in the algo trade Camp

I'll show you exactly how to automate

your trading strategy and if you don't

have one we have hundreds we've

researched from phds to get you started

on your journey right now and I want to

help you automate your trading right now

not a year from now no I want to help

you right now if you don't don't know

how to code don't worry I didn't know

how to code either I'll teach you step

by step in the next 15 days listen I had

one bot that did me hundreds of

thousands of dollars and I don't have a

big team or an unfair Advantage I'm

standing here in a bedroom with a

whiteboard behind me I don't have

employees investors or any long-term

obligations I'm Free as a bird I don't

have a Lambo or some fancy New York City

office or Miami office I'm a simple guy

with a simple life all I do is code with

AI Live on YouTube Just Me you my

computer and my whiteboard quick story I

like to leave out because it's a little

bit embarrassing but when I first got

interested in automating my trading I

knew I had to learn to code because it

would just be way too expensive to hire

a developer to constantly update my bots

anyways I locked in for 2 to 4 hours a

day until I successfully built my first

bot and then I put 10K in and over the

next 30 days I watch that 10K go to zero

no wonder I was a losing hand Trader I

was trading a strategy that didn't work

a strategy a bot couldn't even figure

out and I was trading as a human that

day though I developed my RBI framework

to ensure I only run profitable Bots my

RBI framework is simple research

strategies R then back test those

strategies B and see if they work in the

past if they work in the past then

Implement them with small size not 10K I

hey I'm moev and that day I developed a

passion for trading Bots and showing my

RBI secret I uncovered duh you have to

test your Bots before you run them with

$10,000 if you can constantly research

new trading ideas then constantly back

test those ideas to see if they work in

the past and then take those that worked

in the past and Implement them into a

bot with small size if you can do that

you can't help but become a profitable

algo Trader I'm just an independent

Trader for my bedroom who figured out a

better way to approach the market and I

believe codee's a great equalizer if you

know how to code you can build cash flow

for generations for the rest of your

life so the way I looked at automating

my trading was I could learn all this in

worst case scenario I know how to code

and I could get a job for like 100k Plus

at a tech company but best case scenario

was I could have automated trading Bots

for the rest of my life now that's a

solid risk reward if you ask me look I

know there's a lot of scam out there I

want you to look me up Google me search

moep you can see everything I am saying

is true I have videos of every single

bot I've ever built all for free on

YouTube including that one that made me

hundreds of thousands of dollars but

just because it worked for me does not

mean it's going to work for you the

number one rule of automating trading is

to never run someone else's bot just

like I got wrecked for $10,000 on my

first bot how would you possibly know if

you downloaded the bot off the internet

what it does or when somebody runs it or

when they are hedging no one will ever

give you a profitable trading bot that's

the number one way to spot a scam so if

you're on the internet YouTube whatever

and it says a plug and play make one eth

a day or 20% a day you know that it's a

scam you're about to lose all your money

you see I'm not the type of guy to Hype

something up I just try to transparently

build Bots that I think will make me

money seriously if you're skeptical at

all I have over 1,200 hours of free

YouTube tutorials all on YouTube you can

literally go get to know me I've even

hosted interviews with the top quants in

the world like Christina she she traded

$7.1 billion per day that's billion with

a b and Dr Ernest Chan one of the

greatest algorithmic traders of all time

after Jim Simons himself rest in peace

I've even had the pleasure of

interviewing some unnamed Renaissance

employees and we talked about the

strategies Jim Simon and his company

Renaissance used to use so I just

rebuilt them and I'm telling you this

not to brag but I'm telling you this

because I want you to take it seriously

because it could change your life like

it's changed mine think about it who's

the best Trader of all time yeah Jim

Simons the founder of Renaissance what

did Jim Simons do to trade better than

everybody else yeah he built trading

Bots that traded fully automatically

even today who's making all the money on

Wall Street yeah the trading bot firms

Google it two Sigma Jane Street a QR D

sha Renaissance Jim Simons died with a

net worth of 31 billion all from

automated trading because Jim was smart

enough to realize there's patterns in

the market that robots could trade that

humans could never so he essentially

executed his own RBI framework for years

on end he once said in a business like

this you just have to keep making things

better and better and better essentially

always researching new strategies then

back testing those strategies see if

they worked in the past and then testing

those in the live market Jim simply

executed his system of test and

deploying for years until he was hyper

profitable look Jim didn't just become a

multi-billionaire he changed Bloodlines

and created generational wealth for

employees investors and of course

himself not only that he returned over a

100 billion in profits and he was able

to give away $4 billion to Charities how

cool is that imagine if you could just

have a fraction of that impact the sad

truth is most people don't actually want

to make money with trading they just

want to gamble but if you're committed

to automating your trading and building

out a provable edge then it's an

absolute travesty for you not to embrace

these principles so your trading can

finally be as good as you know it should

be without human intervention now on

this page you'll see exactly what's

covered in the 15-day algo trade Camp if

you think this stuff will help you

automate your trading then grab your

spot now and at the risk of sounding

bold and I genuinely mean this

I think my stuff is the best not because

of how much money I've made from my bots

but because there are plenty of people

out there who have made a lot more money

than I have but more importantly I don't

think many people share any of this

stuff and I believe I explain everything

in the most simple manner so you can

actually automate your trading as a

regular person I don't care how rich the

gurus are they make trading way too

complicated and no one shows you how to

automate it my goal is to make

automating your trading simple so you

can do it so my advice is to grab a

general admission or a VIP seat to the

algo trade camp and I highly recommend

you grab a VIP ticket because they get

lifetime access to the boot camp and

they get access to our Inner Circle

calls which are every Friday on Zoom

with replays available so you definitely

don't want to miss that opportunity I

highly recommend the VIP option here's

the deal you can join the masses and you

can invest in cheap solutions or you can

invest in something that actually works

so if you're interested in automating

your trading then grab your spot at the

boot camp below and trust me you'll want

to get the VIP experience that's where

we really roll up our sleeves and make

the magic happen so Step Up start the

Alo trade camp and to ensure you have

absolutely zero risk I've implemented a

90day cosmic guarant guarantee so you

don't even have to say yes right now

just say maybe sign up you can watch all

of the boot camp explore all of the back

tests the Bots connect with all of the

hundreds of algorithmic traders in there

and if it's not for you you have 90 full

days in our 90day Cosmic 100% money back

guarantee to just test it out so jump in

right now say hello in the members chat

me and hundreds of other automated

Traders are waiting to step on the gas

with

you I've made hundreds of thousands of

dollars with this trading bot framework

and I'm not only going to let you steal

it I'm going to help you master it in

that one that made me hundreds of

worked for me does not mean it's going

to to work for you the hey did that make

a whole video through how long did that

take I have no idea I'm sorry if it

didn't go all the way through and you're

interested in that my bad but check out

the website below you can check it out

if you'd like um but much love to you

sorry I just had to lock back in bro

just had to lock I have to stay locked

dude I got to stay locked so much love

to you thanks for thanks for waiting for

me I don't know if that was 5 minutes or

15 minutes either way we back boy let me

know if you know in the chat was that

was that did you see the video one time

or one and a half

times concept of time around here is

really really bad it's

poor okay so how are we going to go

ahead and get these candles shot data

maybe no close all positions no close

all positions Market no calculate

range should we quote orders calculate

Binger bands calculate linear

regression a lot of good stuff on the

screen BR bruh order book data order

book data

[Music]

no open order Deluxe

here damn dude how do I get the open

interest we need that basic withdrawal

cancel orders

config let's go back here test get

ignore

security API here

AO moev 777 fcoin has high funding at

55. 84% annual AI suggests buy with 55%

confidence analysis negative funding

rate in an uptrending

Market I feel like it's exchange that P1

maybe I just need to get the

data slippage

price post action I need to get the open

interest no I don't need the open

interest I need the

uh I need the uh funding rate

the FY right the FY right

okay

so I can close this for now this is live

these are live

here I'm going to set alarm here for how

long has it been it's been an hour and a

half took me 40 minutes to get it set up

so what about another 45 to get 25% done

so another so another 45 45 45 I have 2

hours 20

minutes

timer go

say all right so we got that set up um

she should let me know when this is done

is just so I don't [ __ ] it up again

three days in a row could you could you

imagine if I did that three days in a

row I would be so so hot dude I'll be so

so

hot all right let's just start doing

some calls

here this start with symbol info because

that makes the most sense so let's close

this close this close this let's go to

hyper liquid uh nice funks hyper liquid

here and this all this code is in the uh

the

stuff get current market info for all

coins on hyper

liquid please update this code so we can

test this G data and all the information

that we get from the the data uh I'm

specifically looking for the funding

rate so yeah just make this a name if

name equals main type file so I can run

it from here and test all the

information that we get now and then

from there we can see if we get the um

funding rate in there and then uh we can

try some other things

too but make sure that this what how

however we set this up I think if name

equals main we'll set it up in a way

that we can it won't affect anything

that we have running right now and it

will only affect it if we're running it

from here

okay so you can see here that I'll add a

main okay let's say accept

I don't see

it n

dude not the API dog

I wanted you to do it in this file not

the other one not the api. py

I'm ready man

if you want a pair of shoes and they at

the store they're really at the store

you just don't have it yet it ain't like

that [ __ ] don't exist it's just really

at the store that's how I looked at my

whole life if I want it if I believe I

can have it then that's my

reality it looks like we get a air here

looking like we get a little erir

here e

add more Prince if

needed yeah she don't work

today 710 don't watch the clock do what

it does keep going Sam levenson let's

keep going baby let's keep going let's

keep going let's keep going going let's

keep

[Music]

going all we can do dude that's all we

can do is keep it moving keep it pushing

dude

I mean this doesn't really look like it

though here's the

response doesn't really look like we

have funding data there that's why I

said uh

[Music]

sh it

back price okay current

symbols ah I see the issue now the

Market info response to the dictionary

with symbols Keys we need to modify your

code to handle this format

correctly AO moev 777 fcoin has high

funding at

54.4% annual AI suggests sell with 80%

confidence analysis negative BTC Trend

and high fcoin funding rate

all right so we need to approach this a

different

way let's look at their API

again it say hyper liquid hyper liquid

get funding rate it's always a good

way that's always good just Google it

dude

funding technical

details numerical example

let's see what they're doing here

scripts here

how you get funny right here

these dogs be eating everything bro bro

they be eating

everything so funny so funny okay so I

don't think this is going to be the one

but oh here we

go there we go there we go this is what

we need

below is how to get the funding rate

please make a function here in this file

to get funding

rate and then let's go ahead and test it

in the main file thing

hey hey hey we can do anything dog

heyyy

hey hey hey hey what up boy remember

that hey hey hey all right so now let's

update

it this is wonderful now let's update it

to make it so that it only grabs the

funding rate for the symbol that we pass

in and then we can pass in for example

uh fart coin

hey oh man remind me with my

pops oh man man man

1.010 concentrate all your thoughts upon

the work at hand the sun's rays do not

burn what talking Alexander grah Bell

because it's for fart coin dude it's

fart coin it's fart

coin is this

fact laughing to the bank like

ah all right let's see if this is facts

B hyper liquid

this fax be

fart

pers okay the funding right here is

217% yeah dude so I don't know what you

want bro 245

okay let's go look at the other one

here

um this one is for ethereum what is

ethereum ethereum what is that

no say cabon no

say never heard of that

before yes BTC what's up well let's see

was this right 10.3 cents percent says

8.2 on there

dude but it looks like we're getting it

right we're just our decimals are

off that's it

um yeah

so let's go ahead and get one more in

here real quick and my dog is eating

everything right now so she's probably

just hungry she's probably just hungry

and your boy is just not feeding her

because he's over here

coding

and he should be taking care of his

[ __ ]

dog you can see that our funding rate

there's something wrong with it it seems

like a decimal problem but I'm not quite

sure you can see I took screenshots of

the actual funding rate annualized and

hourly here on the um hyper liquid they

show the hourly and then the annualized

so you see the three screenshots and

then you also see our printouts and

they're just different but they look

like they are somewhat similar at the

same time just like maybe our p uh

decimal places that are off but you tell

me dude

let's get you some food

girl e

AO moev

777 fcoin has high funding at

46.4% annual AI suggests nothing with

50% confidence analysis fcoin has a high

funding rate of

46.4% indicating a potential

overheat e

what she

say can somebody tell me what this

ethereum token

is is that like some sort of meme coin

or

something

ethereum it's right here it's start the

symbol is

eth is that like similar to fart

coin I just don't know looking at your

screenshots and comparing them to our

output I see the issue let me break down

what's happening from your screenshots

first coin chose annualized 216 hourly

this

okay the issue is hyper liquid API is

funny rate and a different scale than we

expected that's it sick

dude okay let's see how it looks now

dude um BTC says it is a 62% and now

it's perfect dude so 60 83 207 perfect

perfect

perfect and then funding agent

[Music]

so annualize is

this let's make a 1.010 concentration is

the key to success in any Pursuit be it

coding or any other task keep your focus

and energy directed towards your coding

tasks let's just call this a funding ARB

agent

now in this file what I want you to

build out

is something similar to our funding

agent but what I want you to do in this

one is to get all of the symbols on

hyper liquid and then Loop through each

of symbols and figure out what the

funding rate is for each one of the

symbols if the funding rate is higher

than the yearly funding rate that we put

at a constant at the top of the code

this constant will be the yearly funding

and if it's higher than that then the

voice agent will go ahead

and

um will have a prompt at the top as well

just like the funding agent and we'll

send in the The Prompt and then

The Voice agent will spit back say

anything that that response says so just

look at our our funding agent and then

build what I just said above so you can

have a

template but long story short you're

going to Loop through all tokens on

hyper liquid using our nice funks HL

that is also tagged that we just built

and we're going to Loop through all the

tokens to see if any hit our funding

rate that we need

so the funding rate for now will be 100%

yearly and

essentially anytime you find one that

does that then we send it to the llm

with the prompt and then we speak out

what the response

is I love this game

dude put

they don't even put the work in

for

having fun my sock now okay so I'll

create that okay I've created the

funding agent the funding Arbitrage

agent that scans all the tokens on hyper

liquid for finding

opportunities uses a 100% yearly funding

rate threshold configurable

nice analyzes opportunities with AI when

high funding is detected makes voice

announcements perfect perfect private

let's say accept here let's see what the

prompt looks like and let's see with

this says okay this agent scans all

tokens on hyper liquid for funding rate

opportunities when it finds rates above

our threshold it analyzes the

opportunity uses the

AI okay you are mundas professional

funding rate analysis you analyze

funding rate opportunities on hyper

liquid the um

the goal is to

find the

best funding rate

Arbitrage

possible and honestly we need to go

ahead

and we want to instruct the AI that

we're looking for funding rate arbitr

and now that I think about it I actually

need to make a list of tokens to do this

for because we'll only be able to do

this funding rate Arbitrage on uh

specific

tokens well let me think about

[Music]

this yeah yeah

yeah so let's put a list of tokens that

the top that will'll do this

for you having fun girl sounds like you

having fun I'm just I'm just happy you

having fun bro yeah keep having fun keep

having fun girl you keep me having fun

you have fun I have fun we yeah have fun

girl yeah you excited aren't you I'm

excited for you

bro yeah she a little Gremlin i m my

little gremlin

that's my Gremlin dude that's my little

Gremlin I

got Yo 777 dude Mev Snips I like it bro

he's snipping this stuff snpp it bro AO

MonoQ Bot 777 fcoin has high funding at

39.99 annual AI suggest sell with 80%

confidence analysis High funding rate in

a downtrend

enela what's up bro bro he said he gonna

buy this stuff buy it bro buy it while

it's on sale

dude all right so I'm gonna say BTC okay

we got to just pretty much say all the

tokens that are on ethereum sorry not

ethereum but I guess ethereum too just

wherever we can get spot tokens

whichever tokens we can get on spot

should be a lot of them so a yes

A so let's just go ahead and make this

list

D making the list checking it

twice

okay bar coin

yes Doge

yes um

AI

ai6

Z

yes AI

xbt

yes Al go AP a r

r start with the volume

on high volume on

Trump um

what else soie I guess I mean sui and

do melenia melenia I don't know how to

say that lady's name I'm sorry say her

name dude melenia

pangu

popcat

with zero bro

[ __ ] it' be better to put the ones that

we can't have access to huh

griffan

per building a funding rate Arbitrage

agent Pendle inj goat chill

guy and I really just want to be doing

this with uh Solana tokens

so that's what I'm really looking

for

mudang I just follow the volume I don't

know about you but me I just follow the

volume that's it pretty

easy pretty easy approach to the markets

follow the volume Big Dog Follow the

volume where the volume

at all right that's a good starting

place um I'm just going to delete this

op delete

madic honestly I'm going delete eth and

BTC as well I'm just going to do this

with Solana tokis

okay so those are pretty much all of the

I mean get those out of here I mean I

keep those I keep those now because I'm

bu I'm building this we've got Solana

integration and Hyper liquid integration

so just want to have the things that we

actually have access to here

okay so this should be good dude let's

go ahead and and see what she

does let's see I think this is a good

amount of coins

here and then yearly funding threshold

check intervals AI

model max tokis I want to have Max tokis

be like 25 20 something's small so you

can see you're professional uh funding

analyst your goal is to identify

profitable funding rate Arbitrage on

hyper

liquid yes

[Music]

dude they don't even put the work in

dude so why they acting like they're

working I don't know I don't

know I don't

know us we be stepping on the gas boy

every

day every day okay let's run this see

what

happens so source. config

look at myv example don't show myv

though so you can see how you can get

the anthropic API key cousin also you

can look at the funding agent the other

one shows you how to do it too

dude e

there we

go

1773 invalid API

response looks like we got a little bit

of bug

here Trump

300% it's exactly what I wanted

dud

yes

4.10 stay focused go after your dream

and keep moving toward also make sure

that it shows the yearly funding rate

for all of them so right now it says

okay yund Dev 777 High funding rate

opportunity detected fcoin has a 14.83%

annualized funding rate AI analysis

suggests buy reason the funding rate is

high and stable indicating a profitable

Arbitrage opportunity confidence

85% so I want to update these responses

here I want to update these responses in

order to give

us not buy or sell options but Arbitrage

or don't Arbitrage options as this is a

little bit different than buying and

sell you would um if it says Arbitrage

that means that we would need to

to put on the Arbitrage and if not then

we win it

yo 777 fam I see you out

there know it's it's what's called

machine

learning so you

find things that are predictive you

might guess oh such and such should be

predictive might be predictive and you

test it out in the computer and maybe it

isn't maybe it isn't you test it out on

longterm historical data

and uh price data and other things and

then you add to the system this if it if

it works and if it doesn't you you throw

it out so there aren't elaborate

equations at least not

for we need it to say if the punding

funding rate is super positive above the

threshold but positive then we'll have

the AI agent say short on hyper liquid

and buy Spot

now if the funding rate is above our

threshold but super negative so right

now it's our threshold is 100 but if it

was like uhga 100 or smaller like

50 then it would

say short I mean sorry it would say long

on hyper liquid and now we can't do it

that way actually this will only work

this will only work if the funding rate

is super high so yeah essentially we

wanted to say funding rate is above X

threshold short on hyper liquid and buy

[Music]

Spot what a

prompt what a prompt bro confuse

them just confuse them

and we want to focus only on positive

funny rates above a threshold where we

can 7.10 your focus determines your

reality stay dedicated to never lose

sight of your

target so we can short on hyper liquid

and buy Spot somewhere else let me

update the agent

[Music]

damn [ __ ] what did you doing where you

even get that paper towel from that's we

haven't had that [ __ ] in GE bro

we don't even use that brand anymore

where you find out

at where you even find that that shorty

you crazy girl you a crazy ass

girl

threshold looks like we

got a bit of an eror here but we just

had it working so I think you can fix it

quite easily

[Music]

all yes I see the air we're trying to

get used threshold in the prompt but not

passing into the call nice

dude so what's going on with these

markets

here well you can just look at trading

View and see everybody get liquidated

it's one thing you can do holy smokes

big bar down

but damn we were at

$109,000

Jesus they even realize

that all right all right

[Music]

holy smokes this is going to liquidate

everybody that levered up right here

it's going to come all the way back down

here I I actually don't like doing that

because that's just like enticing people

to hand trade I don't like making

predictions here dude no way no way dude

I just know all the only prediction I

can make here is I know everybody that

uses leverage will get liquidated

because I might want to change the

we'll use the config ones normally but

there should be override kind of like in

everything's in the source file folder

you can see funny rate Arbitrage agent

added so we added that here today and it

should be right here funding ARB agent

here just the one that I'm running right

now so that's pretty far dude um every

day we ship we ship ship ship ship ship

while I Yap we Yap and ship that's all

we do dude so all we do right here dude

is Yapp and ship so grateful that you're

here much love to

you I believe CO's a great equalizer so

I try to share

everything not just some things but

everything

and it is all shared here so just make

sure you lock in every day all

right I've made hundreds of thousands of

dollars with this trading bot framework

and I'm not only going to let you steal

it I'm going to help you master it in

the next 15 days in the algo trade Camp

if you are a crypto Trader who is

ambitious committed and persistent and

you're typically good at what you do but

your trading results are just not where

you want them to be well here's a quick

question for you how would it feel if

you could have a trading bot that traded

for you for the rest of your life with

or without you logging into the computer

each day you see I'm just a regular dude

but for the last few years I've been

using trading Bots to manage my

admittedly low seven figure personal

portfolio While others struggle with

controlling their emotions staring at

the charts all day when you meet me at

the algo trade Camp I'm going to give

you my exact blueprint look we've all

seen the countless ads the cliches the

kids in the rented lamb telling you how

to trade this isn't that this is a

proven trading bot system backed by real

data and thousands of hours of research

into automated trading systems I put

this system to the test using it to

build a swarm of trading Bots to manage

my own personal portfolio while I can't

give you a plug-and play set and forget

and make a billion dollars overnight bot

I put my money where my mouth is and I

use this exact framework to build all of

my trading bot but look you've seen

trading bots in the wild you've heard of

successful algo Traders and you hear of

quants that have become wildly

successful and make crazy money so you

know it's possible to automate your

trading and you're watching this video

right now so I know you're super smart

because searching for a better more

efficient way to trade that's just

something smart people do and because

you're smart you also know there's a

little something extra you know there's

a little piece of magic Miss mixed into

all of now I know what it feels like

dude not just to not make money trading

but to lose money due to emotions or

just my poor human judgment everything

else I could just work harder at and I

would get better but for trading for

some reason I could never get over the

emotions the times where I'd be up all

night staring at the charts just hoping

it would go my way just to fall asleep

to a liquidation email when you know

you're ambitious and you're extremely

persistent but you just can't figure out

the game of trading and to feel like

dude I'm I'm never going to stop trading

but I keep losing look I get that it's

normal for manual Traders hand Traders

lose money remember 95% lose I want to

take you from that feeling of losing due

to emotions to being a dominant force in

the crypto

Market I want to help you automate your

trading for the rest of your life so you

can build any trading bot that you could

ever imagine I will help you automate

your trading only only if you are

willing to step up challenge yourself

and take this Challenge and I will help

you automate your trading in the next 15

days in the algo trade Camp here's the

big secret you've been waiting for as an

automated Trader from home there's

really only three things you need to do

to be extremely successful number one

you have to build great trading ideas

build a list of great trading ideas you

then test those ideas to see if they

worked in the past

and if they worked in the past then

build a bot with tiny size to make sure

they still work in the live market if

you can do all three of those things

it's pretty hard not to make money in

fact I've never seen anyone who has

great trading ideas who tested them

constantly and deployed them with tiny

size not have success with algo trading

I just haven't seen it dude and here's

another Fact one good trading bot can

wipe out all bad financial decisions you

made in your entire life and I know this

because it happened to me when you

combine these three different elements

success isn't only possible it's

repeatable this is my RBI framework it

comes down to researching R back testing

B and then implementing into Bots I and

when you make the right decision and you

decide to meet me in the algo trade Camp

I'll show you exactly how to automate

your trading strategy and if you don't

have one we have hundreds we've

researched from phds to get you started

on your journey right now and I want to

help you automate your trading right now

not a year from now no I want to help

you right now if you don't know how to

code don't worry I didn't know how to

code either I'll teach you step by step

in the next 15 days listen I had one bot

that did me hundreds of thousands of

dollars and I don't have a big team or

an unfair Advantage I'm standing here in

a bedroom with a whiteboard behind

behind me I don't have employees

investors or any long-term obligations

I'm Free as a bird I don't have a Lambo

or some fancy New York City office or

Miami office I'm a simple guy with a

simple life all I do is code with AI

Live on YouTube Just Me you my computer

and my whiteboard quick story I like to

leave out because it's a little bit

embarrassing but when I first got

interested in automating my trading I

knew I had to learn to code because it

would just be way too expensive to hire

a developer to cont constantly update my

bots anyways I locked in for 2 to 4

hours a day until I successfully built

my first bot and then I put 10K in and

over the next 30 days I watched that 10K

go to zero no wonder I was a losing hand

Trader I was trading a strategy that

didn't work a strategy a bot couldn't

even figure out and I was trading it as

a human that day though I developed my

RBI framework to ensure I only run

profitable Bots my RBI framework is

simple res search strategies R then back

test those strategies B and see if they

work in the past if they work in the

past then Implement them with small size

not 10K I hey I'm Mev and that day I

developed a passion for trading Bots and

showing my RBI secret I uncovered duh

you have to test your Bots before you

run them with

$10,000 if you can constantly research

new trading ideas then constantly back

test those ideas to see if they work in

the past and then take those that worked

in the past and Implement them into a

bot with small size if you can do that

you can't help but become a profitable

algo Trader I'm just an independent

Trader from my bedroom who figured out a

better way to approach the market and I

believe code's a great equalizer if you

know how to code you can build cash flow

for generations for the rest of your

life so the way I looked at automating

my trading was I could learn all this in

worst case scenario I know how to code

and I could get a job for like 100k Plus

at a tech company but best case scenario

was I could have automated trading mods

for the rest of my life now that's a

solid risk reward if you ask me look I

know there's a lot of scammers out there

I want you to look me up Google me

search Moon you can see everything I am

saying is true I have videos of every

single bot I've ever built all for free

on YouTube including that one that made

me hundreds of thousands of dollars but

just because it worked for me does not

mean it's going to work for you the

number one rule of automating trading is

to never run someone else's bot just

like I got wrecked for $10,000 on my

first bot how would you possibly know if

you downloaded a bot off the internet

what it does or when somebody runs it or

when they are hedging no one will ever

give you a profitable trading bot that's

the number one way to spot a scam so if

you're on the internet YouTube whatever

and it says a plug and play make one eth

a day or 20% a day you know that it's a

scam you're about to lose all your money

you see I'm not the type of guy to Hype

something up I just try to transparently

build Bots that I think will make me

money seriously if you're skeptical at

all I have over 1,200 hours of free

YouTube tutorials all on YouTube you can

literally go get to know me I've even

hosted interviews with the top quants in

the world like Christina shei she traded

7.1 billion dollar per day that's

billion with a b and Dr Ernest Chan one

of the the greatest algorithmic traders

of all time after Jim Simons himself

rest in peace I've even had the pleasure

of interviewing some unnamed Renaissance

employees and we talked about the

strategies Jim Simons and his company

Renaissance used to use I just rebuilt

them and I'm telling you this not to

brag but I'm telling you this because I

want you to take it seriously because it

could change your life like it's changed

mine think about it who's the best

Trader of all time yeah Jim Simon the

founder of Renaissance what did Jim

Simons do to trade better than everybody

else yeah he built trading Bots that

traded fully automatically even today

who's making all the money on Wall

Street yeah the trading bot firms Google

it two Sigma Jan Street aqr D sha

Renaissance Jim Simons died with a net

worth of 31 billion all from automated

trading because Jim was smart enough to

realize there's patterns in the market

that robots could trade that humans

could never so he essentially executed

his own RBI framework for years on end

he once said in a business like this you

you just have to keep making things

better and better and better essentially

always researching new strategies then

back testing those strategies see if

they worked in the past and then testing

those in the live market Jim simply

executed his system of testing and

deploying for years until he was hyper

profitable look Jim didn't just become a

multi-billionaire he changed Bloodlines

and created generational wealth for

employees investors and of course

himself not only that he returned over

aund billion in profits and he was able

to give away $4 billion to Charities how

cool is that imagine if you could just

have a fraction of that impact the sad

truth is most people don't actually want

to make money with trading they just

want to gamble but if you're committed

to automating your trading and building

out a provable edge then it's an

absolute travesty for you not to embrace

these principles so your trading can

finally be as good as you know it should

be without human intervention now on

this page you'll see exactly what's

covered in the 15-day algo trade Camp if

you think this stuff will help you

automate your trading then grab your

spot now and at the risk of sounding

bold and I genuinely mean this I think

my stuff is the best not because of how

much money I've made from my bots but

because there are plenty of people out

there who have made a lot more money

than I have but more importantly I don't

think many people share any of this

stuff and I believe I explained

everything in the most simple manner so

you can actually automate your trading

as a regular person I don't care how

rich the gurus are they make trading way

too complicated and no one shows you how

to automate it my goal is to make

automating your trading simple so you

can do it so my advice is to grab a

general admission or a VIP seat to the

algo trade camp and I highly recommend

you grab a VIP ticket because they get

lifetime access to the boot camp and

they get access to our Inner Circle

calls which are every Friday on Zoom

with replays available so you definitely

don't want to miss that opportunity I

highly recommend the VIP option here's

the deal you can join the masses and you

can invest in cheap solutions or you can

invest in something that actually works

so if you're interested in automating

your trading then grab your spot at the

boot camp below and trust me you'll want

to get the VIP experience that's where

we really roll up our sleeves and make

the magic happen so Step Up start the

algo trade camp and to ensure you have

absolutely zero risk I've implemented a

90day cosmic guarantee so you don't even

have to say yes right now just say maybe

sign up you can watch all of the boot

camp explore all of the back tests the

bot connect with all of the hundreds of

algorithmic traders in there and if it's

not for you you have 90 full days in our

90day Cosmic 100% money back guarantee

to just test it out so jump in right now

say hello in the members chat me and

hundreds of other automated Traders are

waiting to step on the gas with

you I've made hundreds of thousands of

dollars with this trading bot framework

and I'm not only going to let you steal

it I'm going to help you master in the

next 15 days in the algo trade Camp if

you are a crypto Trader who is ambitious

committed and persistent and you're

typically good at what you do but your

trading results are just not where you

want them to be well here's a quick

question for you how would it feel if

you could have a trading bot that traded

for you for the rest of your life with

or without you logging into the computer

each day you see I'm just a regular dude

but for the last few years I've been

using trading Bots to manage my

admittedly low s fig personal portfolio

While others struggle with controlling

their emotions staring at the charts all

day when you meet me at the algo trade

Camp I going to give you my exact

blueprint look we've all seen the

countless ads the cliches the kids in

the rented Lambos telling you how to

trade this isn't that this is a proven

trading bot system backed by real data

and thousands of hours of research into

automated trading systems I put this

system to the test using it to build a

swarm of trading Bots to manage my own

personal portfolio while I can't give

you a plug-and playay set and forget and

make a billion dollars overnight bot I

put my money where my mouth is and I use

this exact framework to build all of my

trading Bots but look you've seen

trading bots in the wild you've heard of

successful algo Traders and you hear of

quants that have become wildly

successful and make crazy money so you

know it's possible to automate your

trading and you're watching this video

right now so I know you're super smart

because searching for a better more

efficient way to trade that's just

something smart people do and because

you're smart you also know there's a

little something extra you know there's

a little piece of magic mixed into all

of now I know what it feels like dude

not just to not make money trading but

to lose money due to emotions or just my

poor human judgment everything else I

could just work harder at and I would

get better but for trading for some

reason I could never get over the

emotions the time where I'd be up all

night staring at the charts just hoping

it would go my way just to fall asleep

to a liquidation email when you know

you're ambitious and you're extremely

persistent but you just can't figure out

the game of trading and to feel like

dude I'm I'm never going to stop trading

but I keep losing look I get that it's

normal for manual Traders hand Traders

lose money remember 95% lose I want to

take you from that feeling of losing due

to emotions to being a dominant force in

the crypto Market

I want to help you automate your trading

for the rest of your life so you can

build any trading bot that you could

ever imagine I will help you automate

your trading only if you are willing to

step up challenge yourself and take this

Challenge and I will help you automate

your trading in the next 15 days in the

algo trade Camp here's the big secret

you've been waiting for as an automated

Trader from home there's really only

three things you need to do to be

extremely successful number one you have

to build great trading ideas build a

list of great trading ideas you then

test those ideas to see if they worked

in the past and if they worked in the

past then build a bot with tiny size to

make sure they still work in the live

market if you can do all three of those

things it's pretty hard not to make

money in fact I've never seen anyone who

has great trading ideas who tests them

constantly and deployed them with tiny

size not have success with algo trading

I just haven't seen it dude and here's

another Fact one good trading bot can

wipe out all bad financial decisions you

made in your entire life and I know this

because it happened to me when you

combine these three different elements

success isn't only possible it's

repeatable this is my RBI framework it

comes down to researching R back testing

B and then implementing into Bots I and

when you make the right decision and you

decide to meet me in the algo trade Camp

I'll show you exactly how to automate

your trading strategy and if you don't

have one we have hundreds we've

researched from phds to get you started

on your journey right now and I want to

help you automate your trading right now

not a year from now no I want to help

you right now if you don't know how to

code don't worry I didn't know how to

code either I'll teach you step by step

in the next 15 days listen I had one bot

that did me hundreds of thousands of

dollars and I don't have a big team or

an unfair Advantage I'm standing here in

a bedroom with a whiteboard behind me I

don't have employees investors or any

longterm obligations I'm Free as a bird

I don't have a Lambo or some fancy New

York City office or Miami office I'm a

simple guy with a simple life all I do

is code with AI Live on YouTube Just Me

you my computer my whiteboard quick

story I like to leave out because it's a

little bit embarrassing but when I first

worst case scenario I know how to code

and I could get a job for like 100k Plus

automate it my goal is to make

automating your trading simple so you

can do it so my advice is to grab a

general admission or a VIP seat to the

algo trade camp and I highly recommend

you grab a VIP ticket because they get

lifetime access to the boot camp and

they get access to our Inner Circle

calls which are every Friday on Zoom

with replays available so you definitely

don't want to miss that opportunity I

highly recommend the VIP option here's

the deal you can join the masses and you

can invest in cheap solutions or you can

invest in something that actually works

so if you're interested in automating

your trading then grab your spot at the

boot camp below and trust me you'll want

to get the VIP experience that's where

we really roll up our sleeves and make

the magic happen so Step Up start the

ago trade camp and to ensure you have

absolutely zero risk I've implemented a

90day cosmic guarantee so you don't even

have to say yes right now just say maybe

sign up you can watch all of De boot

camp explore all of the back tests the

Bots connect with all of the hundreds of

algorithmic traders in there and if it's

not for you you have 90 full days in our

90day Cosmic 100 100% money back

guarantee to just test it out so jump in

right now say hello in the members chat

me and hundreds of other automated

Traders are waiting to step on the gas

with

you I've made hundreds of thousands of

dollars with this trading bot framework

and I'm not only going to let you steal

it I'm going to help you master it in

the next 15 days in the algo trade Camp

if you are a crypto Trader who is

ambitious committed and persistent and

you're typically good at what you do but

your trading results are just not where

you want them to be well here's a quick

question for you how would it feel if

you could have a trading bot that traded

for you for the rest of your life with

or without you logging into the computer

each day you see I'm just a regular dude

but for the last few years I've been

using trading Bots to manage my

admittedly low s fig personal portfolio

While others struggle with controlling

their emotions staring at the charts all

day when you meet me at the algo

hey real talk though me I can't wait I

can't wait till this little thing comes

in I got this little thing for my dog to

St yapping so much real talk real talk

it's not a shot caller though it's not a

shot caller don't worry I'm not I'm not

doing that yet not yet not yet no no I

can't do that that I don't want to hurt

her I don't want to hurt her but it

sends out a sound sends out a sound and

it's like yo shut your ass up I love you

you so so much but I need you to be a

little quieter stop having so much fun

have fun without yapping so much it's

like me like I'm the only yapper around

here

okay

okay okay dude

okay so I got to fix this as well

because it looks like day 30 is opening

it up and I I get hit up so about this

so so much dude so I'm just going to fix

it I'm just going to fix it see let's

see here month two

unlocked okay so how many days is this

okay that's one two 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10

11 I knew I was going to make it I just

ain't know

how but I knew this world is what you

make it you create your own environment

it all starts with a vision what you can

imagine you can

create

24 27

oh it's because my [ __ ] math is off

bro Jesus hey we're at 88% by the way

and I'm going to take any questions you

have right now so if you got questions

about anything this is Question Time Q&A

time I know I don't mess with the chat

like that during the day but oh it's

because my [ __ ] math is off bro all

right I got to do my my thing Trump coin

crashing again LMO 777 what llm you

advise to use no Financial advice I got

something free at the channel

mo.com uh mo.com has got all the

freebies all the freebies BR bruh glad

you're here for the

freebies he want that free sample he

wants that Costco Sample I got you dude

you can have the Costco Sample today

only today only Costco say for

you all right there we go how's that if

you got any questions or anything let me

know let me know let me know let me

know all right let me fix my math before

or anything here so one day one day

after two days after three four 5 6 7 8

9 10 11 12 13

14

50 17 18

19 21 10 days yeah 24

27 that's why

dude jeez 5 days 2427 I need to make

this six

days there we go that's my bad

bro and then we'll make this five days

here okay now let's count it back up 11

13 14 15

17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

30 31 32 okay I like that 32 32

days because then it should be open up

for sure yeah I like that I like that

I'm going to make it 33 days just in

case

just in case

because it's clearly been something that

has I've been effed up on you can see

Grayson asked he said hey I've reached

day 30 according to the emails I'm

getting from

Mund will I be able to access month two

videos and then I said yeah in the next

couple days sorry I think the emails

trigger a bit early and they do they do

dude so

what llm agents you

use uh I've been using Hau

Hau nice dude looks good

from Hong Kong what up

bro waking up at 4:00 a.m. MAV is

already

live oh my goodness that's a good

one my current habit I'm working on

avoiding screen time nice

still yo I thought this was a pretty

cool little setup here homeboy got the

uh four screens with the computer with

the color of the computer this just

looks clean bro it's clean setup dude is

that is that the little sucess usually

comes to those who are too busy to be

looking for it hey you hey you're done

I'm cutting you off for the day buddy

cutting you off for the day okay so I

think I fixed the problem here with the

the access yo 777 Freeman how are you

how are you how are you he's free all

right we

got let's say zoom out a little bit here

got Freeman 777 I want to see these

licks come

through and we have 90% here on the on

this and you already see everything

about the boot camp so so if you got any

questions or anything we do have that

the discount here if you're watching

this live but if you're not watching it

live then you

know kind of kind of don't you kind of

don't get this discount I mean maybe if

you're super lucky but probably

not probably not dude probably

not you got any questions about it let

me know let me know let me know let me

know let's get this over here

okay see what else I got on my list of

things I'm I'm waiting here literally

just waiting for this to be done 91%

complete here so I want to get this

second one up because I've been messing

up lately laying them run all day I

built the funding

Arbitrage AI agent today so that was

far that was super far super duper far

you could see here you can get access to

all the code here mv.com

777 dude much love to you much love so

the idea behind today was the funding

the funding rate Arbitrage

agent because these funding rates have

been going crazy

dude

so actually want to talk about that a

little bit yeah I'm just going to dive

in and just ask more questions if y'all

ain't got no [ __ ] questions for

me I got questions for the AI

you

know oh my God if y'all ain't got

questions for me I got questions for AI

all

day so my one concern concern here with

this funding rate Arbitrage agent in the

future we're going to implement the

trading right now it's just voice but my

concern is as

follows there tends to be a good amount

of slippage on

Solana how would we execute this funy

rate Arbitrage to still be

profitable and what number at what rate

at what rate of funding rate will it

have to be profitable because we get

paid on the

hourly so the funding rate you know I

know we print out the

yearly but we get paid on the hourly

every hour on hyper liquid so to capture

that funy rate Arbitrage we would just

have to be in there in the last minute

or two of the trade and then spot but My

worry is the slippage in the

fees slippage of fees I think the fee on

Jupiter is

.1% and

the slippage could be another

0.5% how high would the yearly APR of

the funding rate Arbitrage have to be in

order

to capture that

value I'm actually going to ask

01 because why not you know I got it

above is my

code any giveaway

no no no no I do the giveaways inside

the Discord now

the giveaways are for members only now

we do $600 a

week so they're actually contests not

giveaways anymore so I just wanted to

Route the money to people who are

actually steing on the guys not just

some people you know on the internet I

don't know that well I know these dudes

kind of at

least so yeah I tried to giveaways for a

while here honestly and they were fun

they were fun like a lot of people came

to the the the streams but I don't

really want that many people here so I'm

not going to like do giveaways to the

public because if you find me that means

you're really working on this and if

you're really working on this then

you're going to add value to my life but

I'm not going to put in my titles yo

$300 giveaway to attract everybody in

the world over here dude you see me

steing on the

gby so I just be steing on the gas

that's it I just be St make a choice

like you just decide decide what it's

going to be who you're going to be how

you're going to do it just decide I

stepped on from that point my bad the

universe is going to get out your way

it's like it's water it wants to it

wants to move and go around stuff you

know I'll be stepping all the gas and be

stepping on my dog too

oh man what a beautiful world

huh excuse

me it's a little Sneezy this morning I

guess how y'all doing

though I'm asking good questions over

here if you got good question you can

ask to any giveaway was the only

question I got

need Moon Daddy to fun you sorry bro bro

no more no

more I can't do

it I want to give it away to the people

that are up in the Discord getting the

Stars so essentially what I did here

dude is I made this contest

here I made this contest channel here

and it's super sick super super

sick essentially two members win 300

usdc each week whoever gets the most

gold stars that's it if you get the

whoever gets the most gold stars wins so

we just get people put in their all into

their post dude this [ __ ]

far what region do you guys use your VPN

I chose Canada but still can't sign up

for

FX uh below is a rough way to think

about when a funding rate snipe is worth

it given you pay a onetime cost slippage

plus fees to put on the trade and then

collect the hourly

funding identify your onetime

cost slippage you mentioned 05 is

possible on Solana swaps swap fee ex

swap exchange fees maybe 0.1 on Jupiter

plus however hyper liquid charges on

opening and closing your short let's

assume a total round trip cost of

6 you pay 6 once to open and eventually

close your

hedge yes okay

26 if you open the trade for just one

hour you still pay 6 and if you open it

for seven

days you ideally still pay about6

assuming you don't get hit with extra

close out slippage

oh that is my timer

[Music]

e

[Music]

all right so let's keep understanding

this pay that 6% once to open and

eventually close your hedge short on

hyper Liquid Plus spot on Solana

if you open the trade for just 1 hour

you still pay 6 if you open it for 7

days you ideally still pay 6 total

assuming you don't get hit with extra

close out slippage or repeatedly

rebalancing understand the hourly

funding versus annualized

funding hyper liquid pays you the

funding hourly if the annualized funding

is R annual then the approximate hourly

funding is

for example if the annualized rate is

100% then the hourly rate is about

that figure out how long you need to

hold to break

even you want your total funding

earn minus your cost to be be above zero

if you hold the position for T hours the

total funding you collect is roughly

that your cost is say 6 equals

06 in decimals so your break even

condition is solving for T So ttimes R

annual divided 8760 because that's how

many okay if R annual equals

1.0 100% then T equals

06 time

8700 = 52 hours 2.2 days that means at a

100% annual funding rate you'd need to

hold for two days just to recoup

6% if R annual equals

0.5 that time to break even roughly

doubles to0

44% if it's 200 it halves to 0.1 or

1.1% sniping the last minute versus

laying it ride often exchanges pay

funding to whoever holds the position on

the hour you can try to jump in 5

minutes before the funding snapshot

collect the hour's entire funding then

close right after but you pay the same 6

each time you do that jump in and

out you may only be able to do that once

or twice before other participants do

the same causing spread RS Mark price

changes or exchange rules to limit that

tactic some exchanges PR rate funding if

you haven't held the position for the

full hour or imposed limitations to

prevent sniping oh interesting hence if

you only hold for 1 hour and pay 6 to

get in and out youd need at least 6 from

a single hour's funding to break even

which annualized to a ridiculous High

rate of

5,256

annual hot damn

dude that's

[Music]

wild so sniping can work only if the

funding rate is extremely high or you

expect it to do it multiple times bottom

line to offset 6% of slippage plus fees

in a short holding period you generally

need a very high annualized funding rate

as the table shows 100% annual must hold

for 2 days 200% one day 50% annual about

4

days and that's just to break even on

your cost never mind the profit margin

you actually want in practice you will

rarely find anything multi-day for 200

plus when you do see a spike EG 300%

annual for a short time it usually

doesn't last long enough to rely on

multi-day

of the funding rate of the same rate so

you'd want to watch for times of

sustained High rates in extremely

bullish market conditions and way

whether you're comfortable locking up

capital for a few days or more to make

it worthwhile hence for your agent logic

it's sensible to require something like

100 to 200% annual if you plan to hold

for a day or two or if you want to jump

in for a few hours at a time you need an

even higher threshold this is why in

real world funding rate Arbitrage you

usually watch for truly extreme spikes

whoa 300% plus scenario stay in the

position for multiple hours or days when

the rate is consecutive or consistently

high so that your one off cost gets

amortized over funding many funding

payments keep an eye on changes in the

funding rate had a great quote that said

rest at the end not in the

middle and that's something I always

live by you know not going to rest I'm

going to keep on pushing now there a lot

of answers that I don't have even

questions that I don't don't have but

I'm just going to keep going just going

to keep going and I'll figure these

things out as we go right and you just

continue to build that way so that I try

to live by that all the time rest at the

end rest at the

end tldr the6 round trip cost you need

enough hours of high funding to out earn

that 6 100% annual means two plus days

just to break even and so on if you want

to snipe for 1 hour You' basically need

an insane rates thousands of percent

annual to cover the 6 in the single hour

in practice look for sustained truly

High

ones please build me a script with all

of these variables configurable that

will essentially be a calculator for me

to understand what rat and how

many periods hourly periods they'll need

and so on and so on I just make it

highly customizable script in

Python okay while she does that you can

see here my G is

done so let's back out of this one here

and see if it's done for the third one

yet not quite so we got to wait a couple

more minutes here and it's probably done

for the first one because we did do 3

two one one two three

yes okay we're Gucci there we're Gucci

there we're Gucci there get him out of

here oh Big Lick Big Lick on the

BTC yikes dude what a big

boy so we got 97% here so we'll keep an

eye on that and when that is

done we will change

it below is a self contained python

script that you can modify and run in

order to calculate various funding rate

Arbitrage

scenarios the goal is to help you answer

how many hours must I hold a position to

break even given slippage and

fees what annualized funding rate do I

need what is my net profit if I hold yes

perfect perfect perfect okay let's go

ahead and copy this code here and let's

just go to our scripts folder here

agents

scripts I need ARM

calculator okay let's run it from here

dude uh uh okay okay what is going on

it's not done typing yet maybe that's

the thing yeah it's still going dude

it's still coding okay or it was at

least okay they it then now okay let's

go ahead here and see see what we can

get

busy let's see what's going on here so

slippage fees okay slipage the fees the

funding annual funding rate 1 equals

100% that's in incredibly

confusing dude say 1.5 so hold hours 42

okay desired

profit

2% calculates various metrics for

funding Carri fre trade or

Arbitrage funding total cost sum of

slippage plus

fees total of hourly

funding okay net result equals funding

Minus cost okay let's go ahead and check

this out I think this is going to be

clean B so slippage plus fees so

interesting to see how they set this up

too they just put it up here in this oh

but then you run it down here yeah sry

slippage yeah okay okay so this is the

customizable part so let's say 1

Point let's say 1.2 and whatever let's

just run it let's just run it nice dude

easy easy money for the AI so you can

see funding Arbitrage calculator

here slippage is a decimal okay that's

05% Fe is .1% total onetime cost is the

decimal

annual funding is a decimal 120% hourly

is this okay hold duration is that

desired profit is that key calculations

here net result decimal so total funding

earned 65% net result is 05 after

cost hours to break even is

43.8 annual rate for break even is 48

Hours annual rate annual rate for broke

break even in 48 hours is

1.09 okay so that's what what we' need

hours to achieve desired profit 58 hours

so if I want desired profit here to

be something

different I just changed it down

here 02 that's

.2% what if I want 1%

profit and let's say the funding rate is

more normal like

0.5 I mean that's still high

but hold duration desired profit

1% hours to break even 104 five

hours uh 280

hours have this

uh right now it shows hours to achieve

desired profits but have that also print

out the days to achieve desired profits

so just divide it

all right let's go ahead and run it days

is 11.6 days so the funding rate would

have to be over 50% for 11.6 days a long

time dude but what if the funding rate

is like

three um let's put it that

here days of Break Even 73 days

17.52 hours

and what if it was like

five 10.51 hours so really looking for

extreme funding rates

though because it's it's got to be a

couple hours so like 10 right here

so that be a

thousand wait 2 two days 5.26

hours It's Tricky It's Tricky dude it's

got to be over a th for 5.2 2 six hours

to break

even so really

it's yeah not really going to work out

too

well unless it's over

like 2,000

maybe 2 hours 63 minutes so 3 hours you

know 2.63 hours however many hours that

is e

all right well interesting

interly I'm glad we have the math behind

this

hours to achieve desired profit of 1%

would be 7 hours over 2,000% but how

often is it so let's go ahead and change

the funding ARB agent it's been real

don't get involved if you ain't going to

die for it take this I bought some Hol

tips for your

homeboy to be a much bigger number well

I don't need to change it but this is

far glad we figured this out let's go

ahead and

say get add then push this saying with

the commit message saying um add oh this

doesn't even work actually this doesn't

even work oh it

does get add push Commit This with the

message commit message say added uh

funding funding Arbitrage

calculator to figure out what the funny

rates need to be to profitly

ARB AR

so funding C yes and I can share

everything on this I believe it's just a

calculator

okay commit added funding Arbitrage

calculator to figure

out I'm just going to go ahead and uh do

this myself

okay and then I'm going to say get

push all right so so I think this

funding rate calculator should be up

there dude

oh what is she talking

about oh she was just talking she we

already got her we already used what she

we already got we got we got everything

that we already got everything we

already got everything that we asked for

from her so let's go ahead and check

this out

here B AI agents for trading

here okay so you can see that we added

funding Arbitrage calculator so we know

we need to hit the funding

rate that's pretty sick though I'm glad

to have that calculator I am very happy

about that what is this

dude January 16th 17th 15th let's get

that out of

here what is that

D live agents

here I don't need this cutesy stuff here

dude get it up out of here get it ghost

bye Quickstar guide okay so we're about

20 days in here dude and I feel like

we're moving we're moving at a good

speed I took a couple days off you

didn't

notice you probably did because you're

like where's moon de why isn't he coding

this Sunday this

Saturday cuz I was on my white

board I'm either I'm either coding or

I'm

whiteboarding or or I'm walking and

reading or listening walk listen I read

all day I've been reading the Bible if

you couldn't

tell I just never read it and if

everybody everybody lives by by the

Bible dude not everybody but you see a

whole world live by the Bible so it's

like okay I'm just gonna read the book

I'm just gonna read it or listen to it

at least so I just been listening to it

and like yeah I

mean just try to input good stuff into

my ears dude all

day all day or interesting things

or there's some good there's some good

like uh podcast I'm always asking about

your guys' podcast for a reason dude if

you're in the if you're if you're in my

family bro you're adding value to

everybody's life dude so it's dope that

we have I asked that question about your

books and your podcast because I want to

know what yall are listening to what you

where you get your information from dude

I'm trying to learn too I need more I

need more so I mean I got so much time

be I got my whole life I own all my

hours so if I'm not coding I'm thinking

about what's the next

move essentially either thinking it

putting it out there on my whiteboard or

just getting the input is like okay well

let me just listen to what these people

people are talking about these books

because books dude books are like

everybody's best ideas so it's like okay

let's input books input books let me get

some books more more more book input

please tell me more books to read give

me more books dude get add do oh that's

my timer get commit I need to go do that

right now before I burn a house down

um this is where you get

started and then and

um oh I didn't save

it my

bad that's way better just say start

here

dude just say start here

dude

e e

so that code should be here now we look

at the uh

we just updated this not even cold bro

it's not even cold dude just updated the

REM right there but you can see ship

features we ship something today it's

120 I think we gota we gotta watch this

happy MLK Junior Day dude

I know we can't watches

but

oh I

got I want to ask you this is the most

important and crucial period of your

lives

for what you do now and what you decide

now at

this number one in your life's blueprint

should be a deep belief in your own

dignity your own worth and your own

somebody don't allow anybody to

make deal de made when I set out at the

beginning of the summer and said this is

the training plan I'm doing I sign that

contract with myself I'm doing it you

know throughout the that process you'll

start talking to yourself like man I got

to I think I need to maybe if we

nope no this is

non-negotiable always feel that you

count always somebody

in your life's blueprint should be a

deep belief in your own dignity your own

worth and your own

somebodiness don't allow anybody to make

you feel that you are

nobody always feel that you count always

feel that you have worth and always feel

that your life has

ultimate significance now that means

that you should not be ashamed of your

color you know it's very unfortunate

that in so many instances our society

has placed a stigma on the negro's

color you know there are some Negroes

who are ashamed of themselves don't be

ashamed
